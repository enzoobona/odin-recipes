        <p>Mashed potato or mashed potatoes, colloquially known as mash, is a dish made by mashing boiled or steamed potatoes, usually with added milk, butter, salt, and pepper. It is generally served as a side dish to meat or vegetables</p>
        <p>An early recipe is found in Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery, published in 1747. Her recipe mashed them in a saucepan with milk, salt, and butter.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cream/Milk</li>
            <li>Seasonings</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the Potatoes</li>
            <li>Cut into quarters and place into cold salted water in a large pot (cold water helps to ensure they cook evenly).</li>
            <li>Cook potatoes in boiling water until tender. The length of time you need to boil the potatoes depends on how big they are cut. I cut my potatoes into quarters and boil them for about 15 minutes.  To check if your potatoes are ready, use a fork to poke the potato and see if it is tender!</li>
            <li>Once well-drained, mash with the potatoes with a hand masher and with melted butter, warmed milk, and salt & pepper</li>
        </ol>
