        <p>The Milanesa is a breaded cutlet, usually made from beef—but it can also be made from chicken or lamb—which is fried or baked. By extension, milanese refers to any slice of an ingredient that is breaded and cooked in a similar way, so there are milanesas made from pork, fish, soy, eggplant, mozzarella, and other ingredients.</p>
        <p>Although its name comes from the Italian city of Milan and is inspired by the cotoletta alla milanese, the specific origin of the dish is disputed: as early as the 19th century, it was known in Spain as “chuletas de ternera a la milanesa” (Milanese veal cutlets) and was said to be of Italian origin. Since the 20th century, it has been a typical dish in Argentine, Paraguayan, Uruguayan, Venezuelan, and other Latin American cuisines, thanks to Italian, German, and Austrian immigration.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 or 3 chicken breast fillets</li>
            <li>2 or 3 eggs</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Powdered garlick</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We start by trimming the fat off the fillets. Chicken thigh fillets have a little more fat and will be juicier.</li>
            <li>Beat the egg in a deep dish, add a little parsley and salt, and dip the previously seasoned fillets in the beaten egg. Cover and leave to marinate in the refrigerator for an hour.</li>
            <li>After that time, coat them in breadcrumbs mixed with garlic powder. This trick gives them a spectacular garlic aroma.</li>
            <li>Then fry them in plenty of hot olive oil for about 45 seconds on each side and they're ready. Serve with French fries! A delicious and easy-to-prepare dish.</li>
        </ol>
